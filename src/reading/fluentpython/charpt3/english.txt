Americans embraced sharing their homes and cars, creating billion-dollar industries. Nannies are next.
Nanny-sharing arrangements -- where a nanny cares for children from two families on a regular basis -- can both allow families who couldn't afford a nanny to hire one and lift nannies' economic fortunes, allowing them to make thousands of dollars more a year than they would working for just one family.
Nanny Lane began rolling out its nanny-sharing service earlier this year and is among a portfolio of sites operated under CareGuide.
John Philip Green, who calls himself the "chief executive dad" of CareGuide, says he could foresee the site bringing the sharing economy to child care.
"If you think about what the travel industry and hospitality industry looked like before Airbnb, bed and breakfasts would have been a tiny sliver," he says.
"Airbnb has gone on to be a $20 billion industry. They redefined it and formalized the price of staying in peoples' homes."
"There isn't anything that's been built specifically to help nannies with nanny shares -- that's what gobsmacked us about a year ago," says Green.
"There are a lot of nanny matching services—we run one of the largest ones—but they are not suited to sharing a nanny. You have to facilitate family-to-family conversations."
